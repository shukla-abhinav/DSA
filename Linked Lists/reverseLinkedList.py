1.  previous: Initially pointing at None, this variable points to the previous element so the node.
    next link can be reversed using it. This is then updated to the node next to it, i.e., current.

2.  current: Initially pointing to head, the node being pointed to by this variable gets its node.
    next set to the previous item in the list. This is then updated to the node next to it,â€‹ i.e., following.

3.  temp: Initially pointing to the second node , this is used so the current pointer may move one 
    step ahead in each iteration.
